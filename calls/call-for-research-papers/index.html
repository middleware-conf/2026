          </div>
          <div>
            <p align="justify" style="margin-top:20px;">The conference seeks original papers of these types:</p>
            
              <li><b>Research Papers: </b>These papers report original research on the above topics and will be evaluated on the significance of the problem, the novelty of the solution, advancement beyond prior work, sufficient supporting evidence, and clarity of the presentation.</li>
            
              <li><b>Experimentation and Deployment Papers: </b>These papers describe complete systems, platforms, and/or comprehensive experimental evaluations of alternative designs and solutions to well-known problems. The emphasis during the review of these papers will be more on the demonstrated usefulness and potential impact of the contributions, the extensive experimentation involved, and the quality and weight of the lessons learned.</li>
            
              <li><b>Big Ideas Papers: </b>These are papers that have the potential to open up new research directions. For such papers, the potential to motivate new research is more important than full experimental evaluation, though some preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the approach or idea is important.</li>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Important Dates, Deadlines, Conditions</h3>
            <p align="justify">Middleware 2026 will have two submission deadlines, and we are providing the possibility of revision decisions for some papers that are deemed promising but somehow not yet complete. A more detailed explanation of the submission model is provided below.</p>

          </div>
          <h3>Paper Decision and Resubmission/Revision Guidelines</h3>
          <p>
            The papers submitted to Middleware receive one of the following decisions depending on the submission track: (1) <b>accept</b>, (2) <b>minor revision</b> (one-shot revision), (3) <b>major revision</b> (resubmissions allowed to the next cycle), or (4) <b>reject</b> (ineligible for resubmission up to a year).  
          </p>
          <p>
            Only papers in the research and experimentation/deployment track will be eligible for the minor revision and the major revision decisions. Big ideas papers are not eligible for revision.
          </p>
          <p>Authors of papers that are not early rejected will be provided an opportunity to respond to the reviews prior to the final decisions according to the schedule detailed above.</p>
          <p>The guidelines for the various decision categories are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Accept:</b> Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.</li>
            <li><b>Minor Revision:</b> Papers in this category will need to undergo a minor revision based on a list of necessary changes, and will be accepted only if the revision is determined satisfactory by the assigned reviewers. These revisions will have to be completed within the same submission cycle, within about a month after the decisions are sent out.</li>
            <li><b>Major Revision:</b> Papers in this category are considered promising but need additional work (e.g., new implementations, experiments, proofs, etc.). Authors may choose to revise and resubmit such papers to the following cycle of Middleware (Summer cycle for papers submitted in the Winter cycle, or Winter cycle of next year if submitted in the Summer cycle), with appropriate revisions. The revision and second review of papers in this category will be based on a list of “revision tasks” clearly specified by the original reviewers and conveyed to the authors upon notification. A revised paper will be accepted to Middleware if it satisfactorily fulfills the revision tasks. This review will be conducted, to the extent possible, by the same reviewers as the original review. A paper may undergo at most one major revision for Middleware 2026.</li>
            <li><b>Reject:</b> Papers in this category cannot be submitted to Middleware until a full year has passed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Authors of accepted papers must ensure that their papers will be presented at the conference according to the conference participation policy. <b>ACM reserves the right to exclude a paper from proceeding</b> and distribution (e.g., remove it from the ACM Digital Library) after the conference if none of the authors attend to present their paper.</p>
          <div>
            <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
            <p align = "justify">Your submission must be made within the due date specified above for the specific cycles.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span><b>Formatting:</b></span> Research papers and Experimentation and Deployment papers must have at most 12 pages of technical content, including text, figures, and appendices, but excluding any number of additional pages for bibliographic references. Big Ideas papers must not be longer than 6 pages of technical content including text, figures, and appendices, but excluding any additional pages for bibliographic references. Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM SIGCONF style, which can be found on the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">ACM template page</a>. The font size has to be set to 9pt.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span><b>Paper type:</b></span> As a subtitle, papers should indicate the submission type (e.g., Research, Experimentation and Deployment, Big Ideas) as: “Paper title [Research]” or “Paper title [Big Ideas]", etc.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><span><b>Note that submissions must be </b></span><b>doubly anonymous</b> - authors' names must not appear on the manuscript, and authors must make a good-faith attempt to anonymize their submissions.</p>
            <p align = "justify">Please submit papers to <a href="https://middleware2026c1.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">https://middleware2026c1.hotcrp.com/</a> (Cycle 1) and <a href="https://middleware2026c2.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">https://middleware2026c2.hotcrp.com/</a> (Cycle 2).</p>

            <p align = "justify">A paper submitted to ACM Middleware 2026 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for Middleware 2026, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. ACM reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from ACM Digital Library) if none of the authors attends the conference to present their paper.</p>
            <p align = "justify">The Middleware 2026 conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date will be when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. Note that the official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. A list of papers accepted from the 1st cycle review process (Winter submission) will be posted on the ACM Middleware 2026 website in May 2026. In October, when the full program is available, paper titles and abstracts will be posted for all accepted papers from the Winter and Summer deadlines.</p>
            <p align = "justify"><b>Note to Authors:</b> By submitting your article for distribution in this Special Interest Group publication, you now grant to ACM the following non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide rights:</p>
            
              <li>to publish in print on condition of acceptance by the editor</li>
            
              <li>to digitize and post your article in the electronic version of this publication</li>
            
              <li>to include the article in the ACM Digital Library and any Digital Library-related services</li>
            
              <li>to allow users to make a personal copy of the article for non-commercial, educational or research purposes</li>
            
            <p>However, as a contributing author, you retain the copyright to your article and ACM will refer requests for republication directly to you.</p>
	    <p>By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies">ACM Publications Policies</a>, including <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects">ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Anonymity Requirements for Doubley-Anonymous Reviewing</h3>
            <p align="justify">Every research paper submitted to ACM Middleware 2026 will undergo a &#39;&#39;doubly-anonymous&#39;&#39; reviewing process: in addition to maintaining the anonymity of the reviewers of the papers, the PC members and reviewers will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure the anonymity of authorship, authors must at least do the following:</p>
            
              <li>Authors&#39; names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.</li>
            
              <li>Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper under review; these can be added to accepted papers upon submission of the camera-ready manuscript.</li>
            
              <li>Non-anonymized links to the authors’ online content must be removed.</li>
            
              <li>Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.</li>
            
              <li>The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper.</li>
            
            
            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
              <p align="justify">Authors should also use care in referring to related past work. The solution is to reference past work in the third person (in the same way that one would reference work by anyone else). This allows you to set the context for your submission while at the same time preserving anonymity.</p>
              <p align="justify">Despite the anonymity requirements, authors should still include all relevant work, including their own; omitting them could reveal the author&#39;s identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced. The goal is to preserve anonymity while allowing the reader to grasp the context of the submitted paper fully. It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines or potentially reveal the author's identity are subject to immediate rejection.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Software and Data Artifact Availability for Accepted Papers</h3>
            <p align="justify">The authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials made publicly available as "source materials" in the ACM Digital Library. The materials will be vetted by the Artifact Availability Evaluation process run by a separate committee. This submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the Artifact Availability Evaluation process successfully and are made available in the ACM Digital Library will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves. For more information, please refer to the <a href="/2026/calls/call-for-artifacts">call for artifacts.</a></p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>ACM Open Access</h3>
            <p align="justify">The ACM Open program is designed to help institutions actively support Open Access publishing. We're proud to share that more than 2,600 institutions worldwide are already participating—covering approximately 76% of all ACM conference papers. To be included in ACM Open, the corresponding author must be affiliated with a participating institution. For APC-eligible articles (research, short paper, and survey) where none of the authors are currently from participating institutions, an APC will be required. ACM understands this transition may create financial challenges. To ease the shift and give institutions more time to join ACM Open, the ACM Council has approved a subsidy for 2026 APCs. Authors whose institutions are not yet participating will pay a discounted rate of $250 (ACM/SIG Members) or $350 (Non-Members)—a 65% reduction. We encourage authors to use this transition year to help bring their institutions into the ACM Open program.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> ACM is not lowering APCs, but is instead contributing funds to temporarily subsidize APC pricing as the community adjusts to the Open Access program. ACM supports a fully Open Access future—OA papers get 2–3x more downloads and 70% more citations. Please encourage your authors to support this effort by paying APCs and by urging their institutions to join ACM Open.</p>
          </div>
          <!-- <div>
            <h3>Presentation Requirements (New in Middleware 2026)</h3>
            <p align="justify">
              As a community, it is crucial to pay special attention to the quality of the presentation, which is an integral part of the conference experience and the spread of knowledge. Therefore, as mentors and mentees, we must commit to ensuring presentations are engaging and the speaker connects with the audience, for example, making eye contact as a basic technique. There needs to be a genuine attempt to engage and promote the scientific work.<b> At the ACM Middleware conference, we expect presentations of the highest quality</b>, and as such, reading off from the scripts without connecting with the audience is highly discouraged, which will deteriorate the quality of the conference and, eventually, our community.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              As a community, we are responsible for educating the new members of our growing community. To this end, <b>we will require all student authors (open to everyone) to attend a session on the art of effective presentation techniques </b>at the beginning of the conference and/or the Doctoral Symposium. For the big idea track, we will require senior researchers (with doctoral degrees) to present their accepted papers. 
            </p>
            <p align="justify"> 
              Further, <b>ACM reserves the right to exclude a paper from proceeding </b> and distribution (e.g., remove it from the ACM Digital Library) after the conference if none of the authors attend to present their paper.
